Data Sources

1. http://www.google.com/finance/historical

2. https://uk.investing.com/commodities/crude-oil-historical-data



Downloaded data from sources has been checked in to folder - src/main/resources/downloaded-data. Ideally this shouldn't be checked in to source code repository but fear is that this FREE data might be unavailable at some time (as happened with yahoo finance)
